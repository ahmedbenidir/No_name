This is a small game that I made in even not 24 hours with the python framwork (pygame), there are missing features that you can add.
My main goal is to create a simulator for a deep learning project.
If you add a touch to this game, share it with us!
It misses for example the respawn of the enemies also a small bug to fix it is that once an enemy killed one can always shoot at him
